# IITC-Ingress-potential-L8
An IITC plugin to find portals that need one upgrade to become L8

On load hides all portals that have a level lower than 7.
To avoid scraping the intel currently you have to click on a portal to confirm if it has 7 level 8 resonators deployed.

The highlighted portals use the following background colors to indicate the portal level and resonator status
- purple - fully deployed L8 portal
- yellow - L7 portal without resonator information
- brown - L7 portal with 7 level 8 resonators
- white - L7 portal that needs more than one upgrade to become L8

Loosely based on the "Hide portals that aren't fully deployed." plugin by Perringaiden
